# TicTacToe
 Practice to make a Java based Tic-Tac-Toe game. This includes both text based and GUI based game styles. The text based game may include three different game modes and nearly unlimited board sizes. The GUI is set to a 4x4 board of "Player vs AI".  
  
The text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game's board size depends on however large the player would like to play on. The text-based version includes 3 different gamemodes:
- Player vs Player
- Player vs AI
- AI vs AI  

## Why did you build this?
This was a challenging assignment I found that would allow me to practice event listeners, java GUI, and basic AI.
 
## What did you learn from this?
Although created 2 years ago, in 2019, this allowed me to learn much more about Java in general. I learned many topics such as event listeners, java GUI, basic AI, automated testing, and early puzzle solving.
