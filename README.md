# TicTacToe
 Practice to make a Java based Tic-Tac-Toe game. This includes both text based and GUI based game styles. The text based game may include three different game modes and nearly unlimited board sizes. The GUI is set to a 4x4 board of "Player vs AI".  
  
The text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game's board size depends on however large the player would like to play on. The text-based version includes 3 different gamemodes:
- Player vs Player
- Player vs AI
- AI vs AI
